# Mars Rover with AI

This project implements the [Mars Rover Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/mars-rover/) using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with the assistance of AI.

## Overview

The Mars Rover kata is a classic programming exercise where you develop a software simulation of a rover navigating the surface of Mars. The rover receives commands and must move across a grid while tracking its position and orientation.

This implementation leverages AI assistance to guide the development process while maintaining strict TDD practices, ensuring robust, well-tested code.
